            <p class="fw-light ">24th  Feb 2024 | Ishan Khana</p> 
            <p class="px-2">Last week, staff and supporters of the American Immigrant Investor Alliance (AIIA) met with the Citizenship and Immigrant Services Ombudsman’s Office (CISOMB) to hold our second round of discussion regarding improvements to the EB-5 program. </p>

                        <p class=" fw-semibold pb-4 ">For many young immigrant professionals in the United States, the H-1B visa system presents a myriad of challenges and uncertainties. As a financial planner specializing in this group, I frequently witness their anxieties and frustrations stemming from the unpredictability of their immigration and employment status. If they want to change jobs or lose their jobs unexpectedly, they have to find another employer who can sponsor them and file a new H-1B petition, which can be costly and time-consuming. Sometimes, they may have to stay in low-paying or abusive workplaces just to keep their visa status. They also have to deal with the lottery system, the cap on visas, the frequent policy changes, and the potential fraud and abuse by some employers and intermediaries. Moreover, they may not be able to bring their family members who are not eligible for an H-4 visa, such as adult children and elderly parents, which can result in family separation and emotional distress. <br>
                            <br>
                            For the average H-1B holder, one petition filing can secure green cards for the investor, their spouse, and any children born outside the U.S. Preparation for filing includes securing $800,000 for the investment, an additional $50,000-$80,000 in administrative and professional service costs, and ensuring all funds are well-documented by official sources. An EB-5 project typically doesn’t repay investors until after six to seven years and that too is an “at risk” investment. For this reason, I always recommend that immigrant investors maintain a financial safety net before making this investment. <br>
                            <br>
                            For H-1B holders seeking permanent residence in the U.S, the EB-5 visa places no conditions on applying, making it ideal for those who wish to avoid backlogs in the EB-1 and EB-2 categories. Petitioners need not know English, hold any type of special honors, degrees, work sponsorships, or have any outstanding abilities to apply. The only conditions required are a whole, sustained investment in a commercial enterprise, ten jobs which are generated through your investment, and a legal source of funds for the investor and their family.</p>

                            <p class=" fw-semibold ">
                                In this blog below I detail some of the common methods my clients and other H1B holders typically finance their investments and what you can do now to start preparing for this investment. <br>
                                <br>
                                To navigate these financial demands, H-1B holders typically utilize the following options to fund their EB-5 Investment
                                <ol>
                                    <li class=" fw-semibold">Savings: High-earning professionals living in low-cost areas can accumulate substantial savings through diligent budgeting and disciplined spending habits</li>
                                    <li class=" fw-semibold">Retirement Accounts: Individuals with sizable 401(k) balances may be able to borrow against these funds through a 401(k) loan, avoiding early withdrawal penalties and preserving retirement savings</li>
                                    <li class=" fw-semibold">Home Equity: Homeowners with significant equity can potentially secure a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to finance their EB-5 investment.</li>
                                    <li class=" fw-semibold">Taxable Brokerage Accounts: Investors with substantial holdings in stocks or bonds can consider a securities-backed line of credit (SB-LOC) to leverage their assets.</li>
                                    <li class=" fw-semibold">Funds from Home Country: Sale of property or other assets in the investor’s home country can provide the necessary capital as long as there is formal source documentation available.</li>
                                    <li class=" fw-semibold">Gifts from Family and Friends: Documented gifts from family or friends can contribute to the investment funds.</li>
                                    <li class=" fw-semibold">Loans: USCIS permits EB-5 investments funded through loans, provided the investor assumes sole responsibility for the debt and secures it with personal assets rather than those of the investment enterprise. (Unsecured loans are an option as well but it can be very tricky to get large unsecured loans.)</li>
                                </ol>
